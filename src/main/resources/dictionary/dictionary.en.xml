    <!--
    <replies>
    The element contains replies, which can be somehow changed in the code before being sent to the user.
    Replies are written in the following format:
      <reply key="Key" format="false">Content of reply</reply>

    Each reply can have the following attributes::
      key      - The value by which the reply can be accessed later. Must be in lower case, words must be separated by
                 underscores (example: `service_unavailable`).
                 String value. Required attribute.

      format   - Does the content require formatting, i.e. Does it need to be supplemented with some additional
                 parameters. Parameters are set using the <args/> element inside the <reply>. It has attributes
                 q - a condition for String.format, for example `%s`, `%d` or `%.1f`, and name - the name of the
                 parameter.
                 Boolean value. Optional attribute, default value is false.

      markdown — Whether the string was written using the Markdown language for further formatting.

        <reply key="lang_selected">Language changed successfully</reply>
        <reply key="lang_not_found">Language not found. Please, try again</reply>
    </replies>

    <!--
    <words>
    The element contains words or small phrases inside. Contrary to the replies, `words` must not be changed in the
    code (except the case). Words can be used as part of a `reply`.
    Example. We need to display the current weather condition in the following format:
      <reply key="weather_state" format="true">Now is %s</reply>
    The weather state can be, for example, either `snow` or `rain`. Then we can prepare the appropriate words in
    advance:
      <word key="snow">snow</word>
      <word key="rain">rain</word>.
    -->
    <words>
        <!--
        All words must be defined for each language used, unless there is nothing to translate, such as the degree sign.
        In such a case, it is necessary to indicate, using the translatable attribute, that the word is not
        translatable.
        Non-translatable words can only be in the default dictionary file.
        For new line use <br/>
        -->
        <word key="word">Word</word>
    </words>
